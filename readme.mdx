## What is CS50?

So as an introductory course, we're teaching you bottom up, like how do you write code?  How does the computer understand code?

Eventually, this kind of stuff, certainly after five, six weeks of this, it's going to get tedious doing some of these things.

We're going to switch to another language that takes away the tedium and allows us to really focus on the problems to be solved once we've graduated to that point.

## notes

Although `int main() {}` works, `int main(void) {}` is better because it explicitly **indicates** that the function does not accept parameters.

[Function Declaration - cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/function_declaration)

```
_noptr-declarator_ `(` _parameter-list_ `)` _attr-spec-seq_ (optional)
```

**_parameter-list_** â€” either the single keyword `void` or a comma-separated list of _parameters_, which may end with an ellipsis parameter.
